# JavaRush

This is my way of learning Java by doing the tasks from JavaRush: https://javarush.ru/.

Please do not consider my solutions as perfect ones. This repository is used just for keeping all my commits but I don't mind if you wanna discover my approach and use my code for your purposes.

If you have any questions or proposals you can reach me by the following contacts:
